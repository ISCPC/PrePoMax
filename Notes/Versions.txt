By Emanuele:
5. 11. 2018
- add support for a bearing load - load distributed inside a hole


By Ihor:
- #5: For the project with saved results FE Model tab is empty when going back: 1. Open any project with results included; 2. On my computer in this case FE Model  tab is completely empty
- add support for importing inp files


By Sergio:
24.8.2018
- basic contacts support
- tabular amplitude definitions
- 2D plot utility 
- exporting results to Paraview (Calmed does not export all values).
26.8.2018
- grapical representation of the node sets, element sets to turn on/off
30.7.2018
- sorting of part names, set names :- this is not possible using current user keywords positioning system with indices
- tie constraint - swap master/slave
- analysis should be run in a separate folder with the analysis name; 
- option to use pmx file folder as working folder

24.6.2018
- stange part behaviour stl unv files with the same name - renaming and deleeting
- renaming of parts on the treeview with the F2 shortcut
- option/icon to hide/show all symbols
5.6.2018
- add mirror to results
19.2.2018
- show material and other properties in results view
- user defined result fields using equations, so the user could add a new field and its equation
- support for the Comands keyword in Step card
- opening multiple results files
- create .pmx file with each analysis run


By Martin:

17.1.2018
- distributed loads, in particular, hydrostatic ones. It is a shame that calculix doesn't offer these by default.
- Get Prepomax running under Linux (with mono framework).
- support of more analysis types, handling of selected data output (dat)
- path plots based on geometric objects or sets of nodes
- history plots based on dat and on multistep field output
- support of contact including smart choice of master/slave and appropriate parameters, correction of overclosure or positioning for initial touch
- Mesh-independent entity selections (possibly using Netgen groups, should these be mesh independent)
- real cad support
- symmetry expansion in post-processing
10.1.2018
- bring geometry data to the results view (Parts already added)
- cutting planes for the results

By Matej
- wrong selection when using thin 3D structures due to the GetNearestPoint selection on actor locator
- Slow animation - change parabolic elements to linear elements? draw multiple models and hide/show them?
  use vtkWarpVector to deform the mesh?
- Custom Type Editor for units and BC https://www.cyotek.com/blog/creating-a-custom-typeconverter-part-1   
									  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ayybcxe5.aspx#Type

- show loads and boundary conditions in dependance from the selected step
- if mesh fails, the history is corrupt - the meshing parameters remain in history
- define the titles of all different message boxes
- min/max widgest are drawn correctly only by using the front view with animation turned on - fix it differently
- deactivate constraint
- naming BCs, constraints ... one name for symbol and surface or node set... -> dictionary<name, list<maxActors>>
- Correctly draw transparent highlighted faces -> unstructured grid -> polyData -> DepthSortPolydata - SLOW
- Reduce the number of commands - as by Activate/Deactivate - NOT ACTIVE ANYMORE
- Add zero increment in each step with no displacements - done for first step
- Faster picking - first a vtkRenderedAreaSelector and if hit do a hardwareAreaPick; Found at tests of vtkProp3DCollection: (http://www.vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTK.git;a=blob;f=Rendering/Core/Testing/Cxx/TestCompositePolyDataMapper2Picking.cxx)
- Add View classes for selected items for property grid in treeview
- Convert from linear to quadratic elements
- add Shell, beam elements

Errors:
- if first step is Nlgeo then all the rest of them are Nlgeo - this is not so in PrePoMax.
- on the wireframe view the query element command does not work 
- running with no Admin rights the number of cpus can not be changed...
- the mouseMove event gets fired every second?!
- there is something wrong when using small dimension: 0.001 - negative Jacobian
- the moment on rigid body rotation node works in opposite direction?

Dependancy nglib - added following files for c++ redistriburable compatibility:

 2015
- concrt140.dll
- msvcp140.dll
- vccorlib140.dll
- vcruntime140.dll

2013
- msvcp120.dll
- msvcr120.dll
