2) Add support for custom colors of supports and loads in the Edit menu - add a legend for colors
3) Use the .pmx folder for all calculations
4) Units
5) Show the "Select set" window at the start of the set editing


By Martin:
7. 7. 2019
0) add all files from the video tutorials to the new version
3) support for smart naming - ANSYS "rename based on definition".
4) MINOR - support for the same names of node sets, element sets, surfaces, reference points ...
5) support for moment loads on surfaces
6) support for hydrostatic load
7) support for de-featuring based on mesh???
10) FORUM!
11) highlight the parts for which the meshing parameters are changed while Regenerate for remeshing
13) create node, element sets and surfaces when needed (load, support)
16) step manager is missing (move up and down, duplicate ...)
17) shape optimization, adaptive mesh refinement
18) automatic contact pair detection
19) support for oppening older file versions
22) add support for changing the active step while the animation is on

1) load symbols scaled according their magnitude • I am more inclind to the possibility to display the magnitudes like in a postprocessor using colors and a scale/legend.
2) vector plots of displacements • This could be a nice feature. I will add it to the list.
3) the capability of doing linear combinations of the results obtained in load steps (this is a must for civil engineers) •	This could be done like an equation combining different field values from different fields. At the moment this could be done using simple math operations: +,-,*,/,sin, cos, abs.
Another very useful capability could be the export of results in vtk format • This feature is also requested by other users.

- Custom Type Editor for units and BC https://www.cyotek.com/blog/creating-a-custom-typeconverter-part-1   
									  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ayybcxe5.aspx#Type

- if mesh fails, the history is corrupt - the meshing parameters remain in history
- define the titles of all different message boxes
- min/max widgest are drawn correctly only by using the front view with animation turned on - fix it differently
- naming BCs, constraints ... one name for symbol and surface or node set... -> dictionary<name, list<maxActors>>
- Correctly draw transparent highlighted faces -> unstructured grid -> polyData -> DepthSortPolydata - SLOW
- Reduce the number of commands - as by Activate/Deactivate - NOT ACTIVE ANYMORE
- Add zero increment in each step with no displacements - done for first step
- Faster picking - first a vtkRenderedAreaSelector and if hit do a hardwareAreaPick; Found at tests of vtkProp3DCollection: (http://www.vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTK.git;a=blob;f=Rendering/Core/Testing/Cxx/TestCompositePolyDataMapper2Picking.cxx)
- add Shell, beam elements

Errors:
- if first step is Nlgeo then all the rest of them are Nlgeo - this is not so in PrePoMax.
- on the wireframe view the query element command does not work 
- running with no Admin rights the number of cpus can not be changed...
- the mouseMove event gets fired every second?!
- there is something wrong when using small dimension: 0.001 - negative Jacobian
- the moment on rigid body rotation node works in opposite direction?

Dependency nglib - added following files for c++ redistriburable compatibility:

 2015
- concrt140.dll
- msvcp140.dll
- vccorlib140.dll
- vcruntime140.dll

2013
- msvcp120.dll
- msvcr120.dll
